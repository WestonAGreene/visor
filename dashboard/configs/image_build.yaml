# almost the entirety of this yaml was copied from examples in the Sys Scale repo. Examples most prominently used:
# https://REDACTED.redhat.com/REDACTED/REDACTED-luigi/blob/master/.configs/build.yaml

# Why a template?
#   Allowed me to use the REDACTED
#   Reduced copy paste errors as I could adjust a variable in one place; if I had split into each their own yaml, I'd need custom processing
#   made more visible the customized variables
# Why not pass the arguments to the parameters upon execution?
#   I didn't want to modify REDACTED/REDACTED/src/com/redhat/mktg_ops/pipeline/BuildApp.groovy

#  parameters from /REDACTED/REDACTED/src/com/redhat/mktg_ops/pipeline/BuildApp.groovy
# Why not use the parameters already in BuildApp? I didn't like the naming convention
